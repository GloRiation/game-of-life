    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
      devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] It is
      a zero-player game,[2][3] meaning that its evolution is determined by its
      initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of
      Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It
      is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other
      Turing machine.
